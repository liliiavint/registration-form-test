# Testing the registration form

_project about testing e2e the registration form_

<br>

## üåü About

This project is for educational porpuses only. 
In the studying process, I wrote tests that involve the use of browser automation to simulate the behavior of real user, effectively reproducing the steps a visitor can take when filling out a registration form.
Pull request are welcome, but priority for project authors! Thank you for your cooperation!

# Registration Form Test Case

## Objective
Ensure the registration form captures user information accurately and securely, facilitating successful user registration.

### Requirements
Gather requirements for the registration form, including mandatory fields, input validation rules, and error handling scenarios.

## Test Plan

### Scope
Determine the scope of testing, including the registration form fields, validation rules, and submission process.

### Test Environment
Specify the browsers and devices to be tested, along with any necessary test data or mock APIs.

### Test Strategy
Plan for both positive and negative test scenarios, covering valid input, invalid input, edge cases, and error conditions.

### Metrics
Define metrics and criteria for evaluating the registration form's functionality, such as form completion rate and error rate.

## Test Design

### Test Scenarios
Design test scenarios to cover all aspects of the registration form, including field validations, submission, and error handling.

### Test Data
Create test data sets for different test scenarios, including valid and invalid input combinations.

### Reusable Components
Identify reusable test components or fixtures to optimize test script maintenance.

## Test Cases Development

### Positive Test Case
Write a Cypress test case to verify successful submission of the registration form with valid input.

### Negative Test Cases
Develop test cases to validate error messages and handling for scenarios such as missing required fields or invalid input.

### Assertions
Implement assertions to validate expected behavior, such as the appearance of success messages or error notifications.

## Test Execution

### Automated Testing
Execute Cypress tests against the registration form in different browsers and environments.

### Debugging
Investigate and debug any test failures encountered during execution, using Cypress's debugging features and test logs.

## Test Summary Report

### Results
Generate a summary report detailing the outcomes of the registration form tests, including pass/fail status, defects found, and test coverage.

### Analysis
Analyze test results to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in the registration form functionality.

### Recommendations
Provide recommendations for enhancing the registration form based on test findings and user feedback.

## Test Management

### Version Control
Manage Cypress tests using version control systems like Git to track changes and collaborate with team members.

### Test Suites
Organize test suites and prioritize test cases based on their criticality and impact on the registration form's functionality.

### Continuous Improvement
Continuously update and maintain the test suite to accommodate changes in the registration form or application requirements, ensuring ongoing quality assurance.
